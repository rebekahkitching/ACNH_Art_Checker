How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a super bare-bones project I use myself all the time. It uses the lovely ACNH API (http://acnhapi.com). 


What I would add:

I'd like to change this to a drop-down list instead of the text input so it's easier for the user to find their piece.
