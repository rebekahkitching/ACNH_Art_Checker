# The ACNH Art Checker!

This quick checker allows you to see if Redd's latest piece of art is legit or not, so you don't waste your precious bells!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a super bare-bones project I use myself all the time. It uses the lovely ACNH API (http://acnhapi.com). 


## What I would add:

(completed 06/15/2022) I'd like to change this to a drop-down list instead of the text input so it's easier for the user to find their piece.
